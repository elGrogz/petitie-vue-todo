# petitie-vue-todo

Playing about with the Petite Vue Stack. I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxxw3qtb3_g) video which inspired me to give the [Petite Vue Framework](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) a try by building a Todo app, something that I haven't got round to yet.

# Spec

I want the app to:

- Allow me to add a todo list with a title
  - This will be saved in a database
- Add seperate items in that todo list in a bulleted list
  - These will also be saved in a database
- Show lists altogether in a grid
- When I click on a list, I see a full(er) screen view of that list
- Delete items and entire lists
- Update items and entire lists
- Add authentication so users can log back in and see their todo lists

# First steps

First I created a repo for my app [here](https://github.com/elGrogz/petitie-vue-todo).

Then I added a basic HTML page which will serve as my main apps page. Despite being the simplest step in the whole process I actually forgot the basic HTML layout so I had to research that. But never fear:
